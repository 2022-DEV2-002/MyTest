The Berlin Clock (Mengenlehreclock or Berlin Uhr) is a clock that tells the time using a series of illuminated coloured blocks

The top lamp blinks to show seconds- it is illuminated on even seconds and off on odd seconds.

The next two rows represent hours. The upper row represents 5 hour blocks and is made up of 4 red amps. The lower row represents 1 hour blocks and is also made up of 4 red lamps.

The final two rows represent the minutes. The upper row represents 5 minute blocks, and is made up of 11 lamps- every third lamp is red, the rest are yellow. The bottom row represents 1 minute blocks, and is made up of 4 yellow lamps.

**Development Notes:**

- The app was built using Android Studio.
- To run the app you also need Android SDK.
- No flavors or any advanced configuration are needed for running the app, Just press the Run button.
- The UI is meant to be as simple as possible without implementing useless or memory-consuming widgets.
- The app was developed and guided by SOLD principles.
- TDD is the technique used while development, failed tests are always written first, then the logic is implemented.
- UI Tests could be done in the future.
- The code is separated into three main layers (Modle, View, Controller) as the project doesn't require more complex design patterns.
